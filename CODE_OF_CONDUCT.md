✅ Be Respectful

Treat everyone with respect and kindness. Disagreement is okay, but personal attacks or discriminatory language are not.
✅ Be Constructive

Contribute in a thoughtful and productive way. Offer feedback that is helpful, not hurtful.
✅ Be Inclusive

We welcome contributors of all backgrounds, identities, and skill levels. Discrimination or harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.
